# Python

Thoose were experiences and projects that I perform for my
master thesis project, that include experiments with
Python, OpenCV, Ros and a kinect camera.

I have files that are openCV basics with python like opening a camera.
Others programs use Machine learning to compute optical flow, that later
could be used to track movment.
The main project was a Simultaneos Localization and Mapping that
could compute the movement and produce a 3d vizualization of the space
using a Kinect camera and different algoritms.
